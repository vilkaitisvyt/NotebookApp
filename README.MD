This is a demo application using:

     Spring boot(Java 8),
     Spring security authentication,
     Jwt for stateless authorization(Bearer scheme),
     Thymeleaf template engine,
     Javascript,
     Html, CSS.

It's hosted at https://notebook-application.herokuapp.com
(It might take a few seconds for app to boot if there are 
no instances running since heroku puts it in sleep mode after 30 min).

Any feedback would be appreciated: vilkaitisvyt@gmail.com
